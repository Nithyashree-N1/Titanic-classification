Following steps help us to construct a system 
 *Data Collection*: Begin by amassing a dataset containing records of maritime incidents, including information about socio-economic status, age, gender, and any other variables thought to be related to safety outcomes.

2. *Data Preprocessing*: As with any dataset, data cleaning and preprocessing are critical. This includes handling missing values and encoding categorical variables if necessary.

3. *Feature Selection*: Determine which features, such as socio-economic status, age, gender, and others, are the most relevant for predicting maritime safety. This process may involve statistical analysis and domain expertise.

4. *Data Splitting*: Partition your dataset into two subsets: a training set and a testing set. This segregation is essential for assessing your model's performance.

5. *Model Selection*: Choose a suitable machine learning or statistical model for binary classification (safe or not safe) based on your dataset and the nature of the problem.

6. *Model Training*: Train your chosen model using the training data, allowing it to learn patterns and relationships within the data.

7. *Model Evaluation*: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, or ROC-AUC on the testing data.

8. *Feature Importance*: Analyze feature importance to determine which factors have the greatest influence on maritime safety according to your model.

9. *Making Predictions*: Deploy the trained model to make predictions on new, unseen data.

10. *Interpretation and Considerations*: Interpret the results cautiously, bearing in mind that correlation does not necessarily imply causation. Moreover, it's essential to consider the limitations of your model. Predicting safety in real-life maritime scenarios is an intricate task due to the presence of unpredictable and uncontrollable factors.

Ethical considerations are also paramount when handling sensitive attributes like gender and socio-economic status. Ensuring fairness and avoiding bias in the data and model is critical to prevent any harm or discrimination.
In practical terms, maritime safety is best assured through proper training, adherence to safety protocols, and the availability of appropriate  can provide valuable insights, they should be used as complementary tools rather than sole determinants of safety at sea.
